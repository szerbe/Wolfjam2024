# Description #
The theme for Wolfjam this year is "connect", so our game is played by connecting blocks together to reach a goal shape. It is a 2D puzzle game with 5 levels. To win each level, create the gold shape using the other blocks. Use the green blocks to add, and the red blocks to subtract. To implement this, we used Unity 2D and VSCode.

# Controls #

a - move down <br/>
s - move left <br/>
d - move right <br/>
e - rotate clockwise <br/> 
q - rotate counterclockwise <br/>
